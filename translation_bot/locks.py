"""One lock per on-disk file, shared by everything that reads-modifies-writes it.

An atomic write makes a single save all-or-nothing; it does NOT order two saves.
Without a lock, load → mutate → save from two threads is a read-modify-write race:
both read, both apply their own change to their own copy, and whichever writes last
silently discards the other's work.

Every writer in this app runs on a THREAD — sync endpoints and ``run_in_threadpool``
alike — never on the event loop, so a threading lock is the right primitive.

**RLock, not Lock.** A chapter edit is read → splice → write, and the caller holds the
lock across all three while ``write_chapter_file`` acquires it again underneath. With a
plain Lock that same-thread re-acquisition is a deadlock; re-entrancy is what lets the
lock sit on the low-level writer (where no caller can forget it) *and* span a wider
critical section when one is needed.

Lives in ``translation_bot`` rather than ``server`` so the engine — which must not
import the web layer — can use the same registry. ``server.locks`` re-exports it, so
there is exactly one lock per path across the whole process.
